This repository contains code accompaning the paper "A non asymptotic analysis of Stein Variational Gradient Descent" (A.Korba et al., Neurips 2020) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09797). It was coded by reference to https://github.com/dilinwang820/Stein-Variational-Gradient-Descent.


Requirements: 
Numpy, matplotlib, scipy

SVGD.py implements the SVGD update and computes Istein (the Kernel Stein Discrepancy).

Simply launch test.py to see the evolution of the particles and of IStein.
